# Dataquest - Python for Data Science: Intermediate
# Python Data Cleaning Basics

**Task 1:**
# Read the text on the left, and then scroll to the bottom
# to find the instructions for the coding exercise

# Write your answer to the instructions below -- the list of
# lists is stored using the variable name `moma`

num_rows = len(moma)
print(num_rows)


**Task 2:**
# import the reader function from the csv module
from csv import reader

# use the python built-in function open()
# to open the children.csv file
opened_file = open('children.csv')

# use csv.reader() to parse the data from
# the opened file
read_file = reader(opened_file)

# use list() to convert the read file
# into a list of lists format
children = list(read_file)

# remove the first row of the data, which
# contains the column names
children = children[1:]

# Write your code here
opened_file = open('artworks.csv')

read_file = reader(opened_file)

moma = list(read_file)

moma = moma[1:]
print(moma[:1])
